Surface the note above to the user during Phase 1 and again in the Phase 8 summary so they don't take a runtime dependency on these APIs for production-critical paths.

Integrate Power Pages generative-AI summarization APIs into a SPA site. This skill focuses on the AI layer (Layer 3): the summarization service code and the `Summarization/*` site settings. The underlying Web API prerequisites — `Webapi/<table>/enabled`, `Webapi/<table>/fields`, table permissions, and web roles — are **delegated** to `/integrate-webapi` and `/create-webroles` so there is a single source of truth for every layer.

## The three APIs covered

| # | API | URL | Body | Response |
|---|-----|-----|------|----------|
| 1 | **Search Summary** | `POST /_api/search/v1.0/summary` | `{ userQuery }` | `{ Summary, Citations }` |
| 2 | **Data Summarization** | `POST /_api/summarization/data/v1.0/<entitySet>(<id>)?$select=...&$expand=...` | `{ InstructionIdentifier }` or `{ RecommendationConfig }` | `{ Summary, Recommendations }` |
| 3 | **Case-page Copilot preset** | Specialisation of (2) for `incident` | `{ InstructionIdentifier: "Summarization/prompt/case_summary" }` with `$select=description,title` and `$expand=incident_adx_portalcomments($select=description)` | same as (2) |

> Reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/add-ai-webapi/references/ai-api-reference.md` — canonical
> API shapes, required headers, site-setting names, and error codes. Read this at the start of the
> workflow; fetch the Microsoft Learn source pages with `mcp__plugin_power-pages_microsoft-learn__microsoft_docs_fetch`
> if the user asks for the latest.

> **Admin governance hierarchy**: all three APIs are gated by a **three-level admin
> hierarchy** — tenant PowerShell setting (`enableGenerativeAIFeaturesForSiteUsers`), Copilot Hub
> environment/site governance, and the site-level maker toggle (for Search Summary: Set up
> workspace → Copilot → Site search (preview) → Enable Site search with generative AI (preview)).
> **Each level overrides the one below it**, so "the maker toggle is on but the API still says
> disabled" is a real scenario — admin-level governance wins.
>
> The two endpoints surface disablement differently:
>
> - **Search Summary** → HTTP **200** with an embedded envelope `{ Code: 400, Message: "Gen AI
>   Search is disabled." }`. The generated `fetchSearchSummary` detects this and throws
>   `SearchSummaryApiError`; the UI renders a remediation card.
> - **Data Summarization / Case preset** → HTTP **400** with `error.code = 90041001` (admin-level
>   disabled) or `90041003` (per-site `Summarization/Data/Enable=false`).
>
> Full troubleshooting checklist (tenant → environment → site, plus runtime version, Bing
> dependency, and cross-region data movement) lives in
> `references/ai-api-reference.md` §1 "Troubleshooting: AI feature appears disabled (admin
> hierarchy)" — point users there when either disablement shape surfaces. Mention this governance
> hierarchy explicitly to the user before Phase 7, and again in the Phase 8 summary.

> **Built-in search control vs. custom code path**: if the site uses the Microsoft-shipped Power
> Pages search **control** and only wants AI-summarised search results on that page, they don't
> need this skill — just the Copilot workspace toggle and the `Search/Summary/Title` content
> snippet. This skill is for sites that build their own search UI or need to call
> `/_api/search/v1.0/summary` from custom code. Confirm which path the user is on in Phase 1.

## Core principles

- **Layer 3 only, delegate the rest.** Web API site settings, table permissions, and web roles all belong to `/integrate-webapi` and `/create-webroles`. This skill creates the summarization service code and the `Summarization/*` site settings — nothing else.
- **Sequential agent spawning.** Per `plugins/power-pages/AGENTS.md`, spawn the `ai-webapi-integration` agent sequentially per target (never in parallel). The first call establishes the shared summarization service file and CSRF helper; subsequent calls extend it. `ai-webapi-settings-architect` runs alone, after all code integrations land.
- **Raw `fetch` + CSRF.** Every summarization request attaches `__RequestVerificationToken` (from `/_layout/tokenhtml`) and `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`. Never route through an OData wrapper.
- **Skip `/integrate-webapi` when it's not needed.** If every confirmed target is Search Summary (which has no per-table Web API prerequisites), or every Layer 1/2 prerequisite already exists on disk, the skill goes straight from Phase 3 to Phase 5.
- **Use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate** — create the todo list upfront with all phases before starting.

> **Prerequisites:**
>
> - An existing Power Pages SPA site created via `/create-site`
> - A Dataverse data model (tables + columns) set up via `/setup-datamodel` or manually — for data
>   summarization and the case preset
> - The site must have been deployed at least once (`.powerpages-site` folder must exist) for the
>   settings phase

## Workflow

(Phase headings below the workflow keep the technical "Layer 1+2 / Layer 3" names because they
describe the runtime layering and are what maintainers grep for. The titles here mirror the
user-facing task list.)

1. **Check site is ready** — locate project, detect framework, check data model, deployment status, and web-role presence.
2. **Find where AI summaries fit** — scan code for search / data / case-preset candidates.
3. **Confirm what to add** — review the manifest and pick which APIs / targets to integrate.
4. **Set up data access for AI** — invoke `/create-webroles` if needed, then invoke `/integrate-webapi` in AI-only read mode for data/case targets. Skip entirely for search-only or when prerequisites already exist.
5. **Add AI summary code** — invoke the `ai-webapi-integration` agent sequentially per target.
6. **Register AI prompts** — invoke the `ai-webapi-settings-architect` agent.
7. **Verify everything** — header-contract grep, `$select` grep, `npm run build`, validator script.
8. **Review and deploy** — record skill usage, summarise, offer `/deploy-site`.

---

## Iteration mode (after first run)

This skill is a **one-shot setup skill** — Phases 1–8 run end-to-end the first time the user asks
to integrate a summarization API. Once an AI surface is in place (service file, framework wrapper,
UI call site, and `Summarization/*` settings all exist), follow-up requests to tweak the rendered
UI (colours, spacing, copy, moving a button, a different empty-state message, wiring a second
recommendation into the hook, etc.) are **not** a reason to re-enter this skill mentally and run
every phase again. Doing so triggers a full `pac pages upload-code-site` and a chain of
`git commit`s for each tweak, which is exactly the noisy cadence the Phase 5.5 / 6.4 prompts above
are there to avoid.

When the user asks for follow-up UI changes to an already-integrated AI surface:

- **Edit the file(s) and run `npm run build`** locally to verify the tweak compiles. That is the
  whole validation loop for a UI change.
- **Do NOT automatically run `pac pages upload-code-site`.** Uploading should happen once, at the
  end of the session, when the user has finished tweaking.
- **Do NOT automatically `git commit`.** Let the user batch related tweaks into a single commit.
- **Batch the deployment and commit into a single end-of-session prompt** once the user signals
  they're done (or when you've completed the last requested change). Use `AskUserQuestion`:

  | Question | Header | Options |
  |----------|--------|---------|
  | All the UI tweaks look good. Deploy the site and commit the changes now? | Deploy & commit | Yes, deploy and commit (Recommended), Just commit — I'll deploy later, Just deploy — I'll commit later, Neither — I'll handle both myself |

Re-enter the full skill flow only when the user is adding a **new** AI surface (a new page, a new
table, a second API). If you're unsure whether a request is a tweak or a new surface, ask.

---

## Phase 1: Verify Site Exists

**Goal**: Locate the Power Pages project root and confirm prerequisites.

### 1.0 Detect iteration mode (before anything else)

Re-entry detection comes first because the rest of the skill assumes a first-time setup. Two
signals together indicate a prior `/add-ai-webapi` run:

1. A summarization service exists: `src/services/aiSummaryService.*` (or any source file under
   `src/` that contains `/_api/search/v1.0/summary` or `/_api/summarization/data/v1.0/`).
2. At least one Layer 3 site setting exists in
   `.powerpages-site/site-settings/Summarization-*.sitesetting.yml`, **or** the user is invoking
   for a search-only target where Layer 3 settings are intentionally absent and the service file
   alone is sufficient evidence.

If both signals are present, ask:

| Question | Header | Options |
|----------|--------|---------|
| It looks like an AI summary surface is already wired into this site. Is this request a tweak to the existing one, or are you adding a brand-new surface (new page, new table, second API)? | Mode | Tweak the existing surface (Recommended for visual/copy edits), Add a new surface (run the full skill again), Not sure — show me what's already wired |

- **Tweak the existing surface**: stop running this skill. Switch into the workflow described in
  the [Iteration mode](#iteration-mode-after-first-run) section above — Edit + `npm run build`,
  no auto upload-code-site, no auto commit, batched end-of-session prompt for deploy + commit.
- **Add a new surface**: continue with Phase 1.1 (full flow). The downstream phases will detect
  existing infrastructure (CSRF helper, summarization service, settings) and extend rather than
  duplicate.
- **Not sure — show me what's already wired**: list the existing service file(s), wired UI
  components, and `Summarization/*` settings, then re-ask the same question.

If only signal (1) is present (service file but no settings), treat it as an in-flight first
run (e.g., a previous attempt failed before Phase 6) and continue with the full flow.

### 1.1 Create todo list

Create all 8 phase tasks upfront via `TaskCreate` — see [Progress Tracking](#progress-tracking).

### 1.2 Locate project

Look for `powerpages.config.json` in the current directory or immediate subdirectories.

**If not found**: tell the user to create a site first with `/create-site`.

### 1.3 Detect framework

Read `package.json` and detect React / Vue / Angular / Astro. See
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/framework-conventions.md`.

### 1.4 Check for data model

Look for `.datamodel-manifest.json`. If found, read it — tables listed here are candidates for the
data summarization API and the case preset (if an `incident` table is present).

### 1.5 Check deployment status — hard prerequisite

Look for `.powerpages-site`. Phase 4 (`/integrate-webapi`) and Phase 6 (`ai-webapi-settings-architect`)
both require this folder to exist. Deferring the deploy until later is **not** a viable workaround:
once Phase 5 has written the AI-calling service code, deploying a site whose Layer 1/2/3 settings
aren't yet on disk publishes runtime-broken code (every summarization call 403/500s until a second
deploy lands). The cleanest sequence is to deploy the **clean scaffold** now, before any AI code
exists.

**If `.powerpages-site` does NOT exist:**

| Question | Header | Options |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `.powerpages-site` was not found. The AI summary skill needs the site deployed at least once before configuring permissions and settings. Deploy the clean scaffold now (no AI code yet — keeps the intermediate state safe), or stop and run `/deploy-site` yourself first? | Bootstrap deploy | Yes, deploy the scaffold now (Recommended), Stop — I'll deploy first then re-run /add-ai-webapi |

On **Yes**: invoke the `Skill` tool for `power-pages:deploy-site` and wait for completion. Then
re-check `.powerpages-site` exists before proceeding.

On **Stop**: end the skill with a clear next-step message ("Run `/deploy-site`, then re-invoke
`/add-ai-webapi` to continue"). Do NOT continue to Phase 2 — the downstream sub-skills can't run.

### 1.6 Check web roles

Look for `.powerpages-site/web-roles/*.yml`. Record whether any roles exist — the Phase 4
delegation needs at least one role before `/integrate-webapi` can create table permissions.

**Output**: confirmed project root, framework, data-model availability, deployment status, web-role inventory.

---

## Phase 2: Explore AI integration points

**Goal**: Find every candidate for each of the three APIs — scoped to AI only.

Use the **Explore agent** (via `Task` with `subagent_type: "Explore"`) with thoroughness "medium":

> "Analyse this Power Pages SPA site for generative-AI summarization integration opportunities.
> Report the following as structured sections:
>
> **Reserved slot markers (check this first).** Grep the `src/` tree for the comment pattern
> `POWERPAGES:AI-SLOT`. Sites scaffolded by `/create-site` with AI picks in Phase 3 carry these
> markers at the intended insertion point — for example `{/* POWERPAGES:AI-SLOT kind=case-preset */}`
> in a JSX CaseDetail page, or `<!-- POWERPAGES:AI-SLOT kind=search-summary -->` in a Vue/Angular/Astro
> search page. Recognised `kind=` values: `search-summary`, `data-summarization`, `case-preset`.
> For every match, report:
>
> - File path and line number of the marker
> - `kind=` value (tells you which API variant the maker already picked)
> - The containing component/page name
>
> These markers are **authoritative placement hints** — when a marker exists for a given target,
> use its file + line as the insertion point and skip the filename heuristic below for that target.
> A marker also tells you that the maker has already committed to adding this AI surface, so treat
> it as high-confidence in the manifest (don't ask 'should we add an AI summary here?' — they
> already decided). Flag the manifest row with `source: marker` so Phase 5 knows the location is
> pre-decided and the agent should remove the marker comment when it inserts the generated code.
>
> If a marker's `kind` doesn't match any natural target page (e.g., a `kind=case-preset` marker on
> a page with no case/incident context), flag as `orphan-marker` and surface it in Phase 3 for the
> user to resolve — either move the marker or drop the pick. Do not silently ignore orphans.
>
> **Search summary candidates.** Find any search page/component (filenames matching `Search*`, or
> components that call `/_api/search/v1.0/query`). Note the file path and whether it currently
> calls `/_api/search/v1.0/summary`. (Note: `*Results*` alone is ambiguous — a file named
> `SearchResults.tsx` is a search-summary target, but `WorkOrderResults.tsx` iterating a Dataverse
> collection is a list-summary target. Classify by what the component fetches, not just the name.)
>
> **Related-record discovery candidates.** Additionally, flag any detail page whose content would
> benefit from surfacing related records via Search Summary — e.g. "suggested KB articles" on a
> case/incident page, "similar cases" on a ticket page, "related products" on a product page. These
> are not necessarily named `Search*`; look for intent signals in component/page names and comments
> (`suggested`, `related`, `similar`, `recommended`, `KB`, `knowledge base`). Search Summary's
> grounded retrieval is often a better fit for this than a hand-rolled OData match because it
> returns AI-ranked citations from across the site's knowledge index. Report each as
> `<page> — recommended Search Summary candidate (related-record discovery)`.
>
> **Data summarization candidates.** For each Dataverse table in `.datamodel-manifest.json`, find
> components that display records from that table. Note the file path, the table logical name, the
> entity set name (plural), the lookup/expand relationships, and whether the component already
> calls `/_api/summarization/data/v1.0/`. Also flag any placeholder posts that already use
> `InstructionIdentifier` in a body like
> `{ "InstructionIdentifier": "Summarization/prompt/<table>_instruction_identifier_<usecase>" }` —
> these are explicit TODOs for this skill to implement.
>
> **Classify each data-summarization candidate as `single-record` or `list`** using:
>
> - `single-record` — filename contains `Detail`, `View`, or `Edit`; the component reads a record
>   id from the route (e.g. `useParams()`, `route.params.id`, `?id=<guid>` in the URL) and fetches
>   one record.
> - `list` — filename contains `List`, `History`, `Overview`, `Dashboard`, or the component
>   iterates a server-returned collection (maps over an array of records). Be cautious with
>   `Results` — a page that renders search hits is a search-summary target; a page that iterates a
>   Dataverse collection is a list-summary target. Classify by what the component actually fetches.
>
> This classification drives URL shape (record vs collection form), prompt pattern (narrative vs
> tabular-insight), and default `ContentSizeLimit` downstream. Include it as a column in the
> manifest below.
>
> **Also check for target-kind / user-intent mismatch.** If the filename heuristic says
> `single-record` but the user's verbal request implies a list (plural nouns — "cases",
> "orders"; scope qualifier — "all open", "my"; cross-record phrase — "for this customer's
> history"), OR vice versa, classify as `intent-mismatch` and flag for Phase 3 disambiguation.
> Do NOT silently pick one interpretation over the other — the target page kind and the user's
> ask can legitimately disagree (e.g., a CaseDetail page where the user wants a summary of the
> customer's other open cases, not this case).
>
> **For every data-summarization candidate (list OR single-record), also capture the existing
> fetch's OData query**: the exact `$select`, `$expand`, `$filter` (list only), and `$orderby`
> (list only) values the component already sends, plus any `Prefer` header. If the target page
> has **no** existing fetch (e.g., a Dashboard or landing page the user wants to decorate with a
> summary card), record `existing fetch: none`.
>
> **Classify the scope** for each candidate by comparing the user's verbal request
> (`$ARGUMENTS`) to the existing fetch. For list targets the scope dimension is `$filter` (which
> rows); for single-record targets the scope dimension is `$select`/`$expand` (which facets of
> the one record). Parse the request for scope qualifiers:
>
> - **List scope qualifiers:** `open`, `overdue`, `recent`, `active`, `pending`, `my`, `all`,
>   date ranges, named statuses.
> - **Single-record scope qualifiers:** "including its <related-table>", "with its <facet>",
>   "covering <aspect>" — signals the user wants the summary to include columns or expansions
>   beyond the existing record fetch. E.g., "summary including line items" on an order-detail
>   page where the existing fetch doesn't expand `cr363_Order_LineItems`.
>
> Classifications (applies to BOTH list and single-record):
>
> - `matches-existing-fetch` — the request is generic ("add a summary of this record",
>   "summarize this list"). Phase 5 uses the existing fetch's scope verbatim without asking.
> - `scope-extends-beyond-existing-fetch` — the request mentions columns / expansions / filters
>   not in the existing fetch. Phase 3 will ask a scope-confirmation question — do NOT invent
>   additions in the manifest.
> - `needs-definition` — the target page has no existing fetch at all. Phase 3 will ask.
> - `intent-mismatch` — the filename heuristic and user's verbal intent disagree on target kind
>   (e.g., filename says single-record but the request says "my open cases" = list). Phase 3
>   will ask a target-kind disambiguation question first.
>
> Record the classification plus any detected qualifier as extra fields on the manifest row
> (e.g., `existing fetch: $select=title,description; no $expand. User qualifier: "with its
> line items". Scope: scope-extends-beyond-existing-fetch`).
>
> **Case preset candidates.** Specifically check for an `incident` (or `adx_case`) table in the
> manifest and a case/incident detail page in the source (names containing `Case`, `Incident`,
> `Ticket`). If both exist, mark this as a high-priority recommendation.
>
> **Existing infrastructure.** Report (a) whether a CSRF helper already exists — grep for
> `_layout/tokenhtml` and `getCsrfToken` — and where it lives; (b) whether
> `src/shared/powerPagesApi.ts` exists (from a prior `/integrate-webapi` run); (c) whether
> `src/services/aiSummaryService.*` already exists from a prior run.
>
> **Layer 1/2 status.** For every data-summarization / case-preset target plus every `$expand`
> target, report a single status: does `Webapi/<table>/enabled` exist, does
> `Webapi/<table>/fields` exist, and does at least one table permission with `read: true` exist?
> Report per target as one of: `ready` (all three present), `missing` (any of the three absent).
> For Search Summary targets, report `n/a (search has no per-table prereqs)`.
>
> **Layer 3 status.** For every data-summarization / case-preset target, report whether
> `Summarization/Data/Enable` and the specific `Summarization/prompt/<id>` identifier the code
> will send exist in `.powerpages-site/site-settings/`. For Search Summary targets, report
> `n/a (search uses the Copilot workspace toggle, not a per-call site setting)` — do not flag
> them as `missing`, otherwise the skill will spuriously invoke `ai-webapi-settings-architect`
> for a search-only run."

From the Explore agent's output, compile the **integration manifest** (the `Source` column records whether a row came from a reserved marker or from heuristic discovery — marker-sourced rows skip Phase 3's "should we add this?" question):

| # | API | Target file | Target kind | Entity Set | `$select` / `$expand` | Source | Layer 1/2 status | Layer 3 status |
|---|-----|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|--------|------------------|----------------|
| 1 | Search summary | `src/pages/SearchResults.tsx` | n/a | — | — | marker | n/a (search needs no per-table prereqs) | n/a (search uses workspace toggle, no per-setting toggle) |
| 2 | Case preset | `src/pages/CaseDetail.tsx` | single-record | `incidents` | `$select=description,title&$expand=incident_adx_portalcomments($select=description)` | marker | missing | missing (`Summarization/prompt/case_summary` not present) |
| 3 | Data summarization | `src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx` | single-record | `cr4fc_products` | `$select=cr4fc_name,cr4fc_description` | heuristic | missing | missing (`Summarization/Data/Enable` + prompt identifier not present) |
| 4 | Data summarization | `src/pages/WorkOrderList.tsx` | list | `cr363_workorders` | `$select=cr363_name,cr363_status,cr363_priority&$orderby=createdon desc&$count=true` | heuristic | missing | missing (`Summarization/Data/Enable` + prompt identifier not present; `Summarization/Data/ContentSizeLimit=200000` recommended) |

Compute the two delegation decisions directly from the two status columns:

- **Run `/integrate-webapi`?** → True if any row's Layer 1/2 status is `missing`.
- **Run `ai-webapi-settings-architect`?** → True if any row's Layer 3 status is `missing`.

**Output**: integration manifest + delegation decisions + existing-infra report.

---

## Phase 3: Review AI plan

**Goal**: Present the manifest and confirm which APIs / targets to integrate.

Show the user:

1. The list of APIs and targets found.
2. For each: which file references it and what the service will do.
3. The two delegation decisions from Phase 2 ("Will invoke `/integrate-webapi` for [tables]",
   "Will invoke `ai-webapi-settings-architect` for Layer 3").
4. Existing-infrastructure notes (CSRF helper reuse, `powerPagesApi.ts`, previous
   `aiSummaryService.*`).

### Approval cadence (set expectations up-front)

Before asking the integration question, briefly tell the user how many more decision points are
coming so the "one-shot" run isn't surprising. Count them from the [Key decision points](#key-decision-points-wait-for-user)
list, subtracting the ones that don't apply (e.g., search-only runs skip the Phase 6 architect
plan; if `/integrate-webapi` is being skipped per Phase 4.1, those approvals drop too). A typical
multi-target run pauses 5–7 more times after this one. Phrase it as a heads-up, not a warning —
e.g., "I'll pause for your input ~5 more times after this (web-role choice, two architect plans,
two commit prompts, final deploy)."

### The integration question

Use `AskUserQuestion` and **build the option list dynamically** from the Phase 2 manifest — do
not hardcode "Search summary, Data summarization, and the Case-page preset" when only one or two
categories actually have candidates. Construct the question text from what was found:

- If all three categories have candidates: "I found candidates for Search Summary, Data
  Summarization, and the Case-page preset. Which should I integrate?"
- If only two categories: "I found candidates for [category A] and [category B]. Which should I
  integrate?"
- If only one category with one target: skip "All of them" — just confirm the single target
  ("Wire Search Summary into `<page>`?").

The default option list, with rows present only when the corresponding category has candidates:

| Option | When to include |
|--------|-----------------|
| All of them (Recommended) | Two or more categories present |
| Only the Case-page preset | Case preset present AND another category present |
| Only Search Summary | Search candidates present AND another category present |
| Let me select specific ones | Always (multi-target runs) |
| None — cancel | Always |

If the user chooses "Let me select specific ones", follow up with a multi-select question listing
each row of the integration manifest. When a detail-page candidate was flagged in Phase 2 as a
related-record-discovery target, include it as a dedicated option (in addition to any data/case
option for the same page) so the user can consciously pick the AI-grounded path rather than a
hand-rolled OData match — e.g.:

- `Search Summary on CaseDetail.tsx (finds related KB articles via generative AI)`
- `Search Summary on ProductDetail.tsx (finds related products via generative AI)`

Label the option with the page name and the outcome it produces, not just "Search Summary", so the
user sees exactly where the AI surface will appear.

### Per-target follow-up: list summaries need an extra decision

For every confirmed target whose page renders a **collection** of records (filename matches
`*List*`, `*History*`, `*Results*`, or the target component iterates a server-returned array in
the UI), ask a follow-up question before moving to Phase 4. Single-record summary targets (case
detail, product detail, the case-page preset) skip this question.

| Question | Header | Options |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Should the summary appear automatically when the page opens, or only when the user clicks a button? | Trigger | Load the summary when the page opens (Recommended when the list is short and the extra API call won't slow the page noticeably), Load only when the user clicks a button (Recommended when the list is large or filters change frequently) |

Both options produce the same hook/composable surface (`refresh`, `summariseWithRecommendation`)
— only the initial state of the wrapper differs. Record the choice per target and pass it to the
`ai-webapi-integration` agent in Phase 5 so it wires the correct initial trigger.

**Scope-confirmation follow-up (when Phase 2 flagged `scope-extends-beyond-existing-fetch`,
`needs-definition`, or `intent-mismatch`):** ask before Phase 5 so the summary reflects what
the user actually wants, not what the existing fetch happens to show. The question text and
options vary by target kind and classification.

**For LIST targets with `scope-extends-beyond-existing-fetch`** (user qualifier detected, existing fetch has a
different or no `$filter`):

| Question | Header | Options |
|----------|--------|---------|
| You asked for a summary of `<user qualifier>` `<entity>`. The existing list on this page currently shows `<existing scope description>`. Which scope should the summary cover? | Scope | Use my scope — `$filter=<filter derived from the verbal qualifier>` (Recommended), Mirror the existing list — `$filter=<existing $filter or "none">`, Let me write the OData `$filter`, Both — create two summary cards (advanced) |

**For LIST targets with `needs-definition`** (no existing list fetch on the target page):

| Question | Header | Options |
|----------|--------|---------|
| The target page has no existing list to mirror. Which rows should the summary cover? | Scope | Use my scope — `$filter=<filter derived from the verbal qualifier>` (Recommended), Summarise all `<entity>` rows the signed-in user can see (no filter beyond row-level security), Let me write the OData `$filter` |

**For SINGLE-RECORD targets with `scope-extends-beyond-existing-fetch`** (user mentions facets / related records not in the existing record fetch — e.g., "include its line items" when the fetch has no `$expand`):

| Question | Header | Options |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Your request mentions `<user qualifier>` — this isn't in the existing record fetch (which selects `<existing $select>`). Which facets should the summary include? | Facets | Include the mentioned facets — `$select=<baseline>,<added columns>`, `$expand=<added expansions with nav-prop casing>` (Recommended), Use the existing fetch's columns only (no additions), Use the canonical `<preset>` if applicable (e.g., case preset for `incident`), Let me write the `$select`/`$expand` |

Translate the qualifier to concrete columns / expansions using the datamodel manifest — e.g.,
"include its line items" on `cr363_order` with a related `cr363_orderlineitem` table via a
`cr363_Order_LineItems` navigation property maps to
`$expand=cr363_Order_LineItems($select=<lineitem primary name + amount>)`. Show the proposed
value inside the option. Any new `$expand` target becomes a new Phase 4 prerequisite (Web API
enabled + parent-scope permission on the child table).

**For any target with `intent-mismatch`** (filename says single-record but user ask implies list, or vice versa):

| Question | Header | Options |
|----------|--------|---------|
| The target page is `<filename>` (looks like `<filename-classification>`). Your request mentions `<user-verbal-qualifier>` — that sounds more like a `<other-classification>`. Which do you want? | Target kind | `<user-verbal-classification>` — <describe what the summary would cover> (Recommended — matches your ask), `<filename-classification>` — <describe the alternative>, Both — wire two summary cards on the same page |

The chosen scope flows into the Phase 5 agent-invocation prompt as the **Scope for the summary
call** field — not as an override of the existing fetch. The existing fetch on the target
component stays in place unchanged regardless of what scope the summary uses.

### Handling "None — cancel"

When the user picks `None — cancel`:

1. Mark the remaining tasks as `completed` with a `(skipped — cancelled by user)` suffix in the
   activeForm so the task list reads cleanly rather than leaving them stuck `pending`.
2. Jump straight to **Phase 8.1** (record skill usage with `--skillName "AddAiWebapi"` and an
   outcome of `cancelled`) and **Phase 8.2** (present a one-line summary: "No changes made — you
   cancelled at the plan-review step").
3. Skip Phases 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.3 entirely. Do **not** invoke `/integrate-webapi`,
   `ai-webapi-integration`, `ai-webapi-settings-architect`, or `/deploy-site`. Do **not** commit.

**Output**: user-confirmed integration manifest, or a clean cancellation.

---

## Phase 4: Delegate Layer 1 + Layer 2

**Goal**: Ensure every Web API prerequisite for the AI target tables exists, by delegating to
`/create-webroles` and `/integrate-webapi` (AI-only read mode) instead of writing Layer 1/2 files
directly.

### 4.1 Skip-check

Skip this entire phase when **any** of the following is true:

- Every confirmed target is Search Summary (search has no per-table Web API prerequisites).
- The Phase 2 delegation decision said "Run `/integrate-webapi`? No" — all Layer 1/2 prerequisites
  are already on disk from prior runs.
- `.powerpages-site` does not exist (the sub-skills both require it).

In the skip case, proceed to Phase 5 and note this in the final summary.

### 4.2 Create missing web roles (if needed)

From Phase 1.6: if no web roles exist in `.powerpages-site/web-roles/`, or the roles that exist
don't match the site's auth model, ask the user:

| Question | Header | Options |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/integrate-webapi` needs at least one web role to attach table permissions to. No matching role was found. Create one now via `/create-webroles`? | Web role | Yes, create via /create-webroles (Recommended), Skip — I'll handle roles separately |

On **Yes**: invoke the `Skill` tool for `power-pages:create-webroles` and wait for it to
complete. Then re-check `.powerpages-site/web-roles/` before proceeding to 4.3.

On **Skip**: this puts the run on a known-broken path — the AI endpoints will return 403 at
runtime until the user manually creates a web role + table permissions. Don't fall through
silently. Confirm the trade-off with a second `AskUserQuestion`:

| Question | Header | Options |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Without a web role I can't set up table permissions, so the AI endpoints will return 403 at runtime until you configure them yourself. Stop here so you can run `/create-webroles` first, or continue to write the frontend code anyway and let me flag the gap in the final summary? | Continue? | Stop here (Recommended), Continue — write frontend code only and flag the gap in the summary |

On **Stop here**: end the skill cleanly. Tell the user to run `/create-webroles` (and optionally
`/integrate-webapi`) first, then re-invoke `/add-ai-webapi`.

On **Continue**: skip the rest of Phase 4 (the `/integrate-webapi` delegation needs a web role to
attach permissions to, so running 4.3 would fail) and jump to Phase 5. In the Phase 8 summary,
flag the Layer 1/2 gap loudly — list the exact files the user still needs to create
(`Webapi/<table>/enabled`, `Webapi/<table>/fields`, table permissions per target) so the path to
a working runtime is obvious from the final message.

### 4.3 Invoke `/integrate-webapi` in AI-only read mode

Build the sentinel arguments from the Phase 2 manifest:

- `primary=<primary table logical name>` (for data targets, the table whose record is being summarised; for case preset, `incident`)
- `tables=<primary plus every $expand target, comma-separated>`
- `expand-targets=<every $expand target, comma-separated; empty for pure data-summary targets with no $expand>`
- `caller=add-ai-webapi`

Invoke the `Skill` tool for `power-pages:integrate-webapi` with a single prompt:

> `[AI-READ-ONLY] mode=ai-read-only primary=<primary> tables=<list> expand-targets=<list> caller=add-ai-webapi`
>
> Configure Layer 1/2 (Web API site settings + table permissions) for the following Power Pages
> AI summarization targets: <table list>. This is a read-only integration — the `/_api/summarization/data/v1.0/`
> endpoint never mutates Dataverse. Return when all Web API site settings, table permissions, and the
> shared `powerPagesApi.ts` client are written to disk. Do not deploy — the parent skill batches the
> deployment at the end.

`/integrate-webapi` detects the `[AI-READ-ONLY]` sentinel (its Phase 1.6) and runs its full flow
with hardened prompts: read-only table permissions, minimal fields list (no PK, only `_<col>_value`
for lookups), and a read-only service layer. It still presents plan-mode approval prompts to the
user for each architect — this skill does not suppress those.

Wait for `/integrate-webapi` to complete. Re-check the file system:

- `src/shared/powerPagesApi.ts` exists
- For every target table: `Webapi/<table>/enabled` exists, `Webapi/<table>/fields` exists
- For every target table: at least one table permission with `read: true` exists; Parent-scope
  permission present for every `$expand` target

If any prerequisite is still missing, surface this to the user before moving on — something in the
delegated flow didn't land (for example, the user declined the architect's plan). Do NOT silently
fall back to writing Layer 1/2 files here.

**Output**: Layer 1/2 prerequisites are on disk; shared `powerPagesApi.ts` + read-only service
exists; web roles exist.

---

## Phase 5: Implement Layer 3 code

**Goal**: Create the AI summarization service and wire it into each target's UI.

### 5.1 Invoke the `ai-webapi-integration` agent — first target (sequential)

For the first target in the confirmed manifest, invoke the agent at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/ai-webapi-integration.md` via `Task`. The prompt below is a
**template** — replace every `[…]` block with the concrete value for the current target before
invoking. The agent does not interpret square-bracket placeholders; sending the literal text
`[search | data | case-preset]` will confuse it.

> "Integrate the **<API name>** for the Power Pages SPA site.
>
> - APIs to wire: <one of: `search`, `data`, `case-preset`>
> - Target file: <absolute or project-relative path to the page/component to wire>
> - Target kind: <one of: `single-record`, `list`, `n/a (search)`> — from the Phase 2 manifest.
>   `list` means use `fetchListSummary` + the collection-endpoint URL form (see agent §2.1);
>   `single-record` means use `fetchDataSummary` + the record-endpoint URL form.
> - Trigger mode (list targets only, from Phase 3 follow-up): <one of: `auto-on-mount`,
>   `manual-button`>. Set the wrapper's initial trigger accordingly. Omit for single-record
>   targets (always auto on a user action).
> - Framework: <React | Vue | Angular | Astro>
> - Project root: <absolute path>
> - If data/case-preset: table logical name `<logical_name>`, entity set `<entity_set_name>`,
>   `$select=<columns>`, `$expand=<NavProp($select=...)>` (omit for search), `InstructionIdentifier`
>   `Summarization/prompt/<identifier>`
> - For `list` targets — Scope for the summary call (resolved by the orchestrator from Phase 2 +
>   Phase 3; the agent uses these values verbatim and does NOT re-derive from the existing fetch):
>   - `$filter`: `<exact filter value to use on the summary URL, or "none">`
>   - `$orderby`: `<exact value, typically mirrors the existing fetch>`
>   - Scope source: `<one of: "mirror-existing-fetch" | "user-verbal-scope" | "user-custom-odata" | "no-filter" | "both" (dual summary)>`
>   - Target's existing list fetch (for reference, may be `none`): `<verbatim URL + any Prefer header>`
>     — the agent MUST leave this fetch in place unchanged; the summary is an ADDITION, not a
>     replacement.
>   - Regardless of scope source: the new summary URL must NOT include `$top` and must NOT set
>     `Prefer: odata.maxpagesize`. Those belong to the UI's paginated fetch only. Pagination is
>     UI behaviour; the server-side cap is `Summarization/Data/ContentSizeLimit`.
> - `$expand` navigation property casing (data/list targets with `$expand` only): each nav
>   property name verbatim as it appears in Dataverse metadata's
>   `ReferencedEntityNavigationPropertyName` — do not auto-lowercase. If unknown, the agent must
>   query `EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='<primary>')/ManyToOneRelationships` (or
>   `/OneToManyRelationships`) before building the URL. See agent §2.2.
> - Existing CSRF helper: <path + export name, or `none — define inline`>
> - Existing summarization service: <path, or `none — create new`>. If present, grep the file for
>   `normalizeSummaryString`, `postSummary`, `fetchListSummary`, `buildSummaryQuery` — reuse any
>   that already exist rather than redeclaring.
> - Placeholder POSTs to replace at this target (from Phase 2 Explore): <list each as
>   `path:line — body`, or write `none` if Phase 2 didn't flag any in this file>
>
> Create or extend the summarization service with raw `fetch`, both required headers, and the
> framework-idiomatic wrapper. Wire the call into the target file with loading/error/empty/
> recommendation handling. If a placeholder POST was flagged for this file, **replace it in
> place** rather than adding a second fetch. Do NOT create a second `getCsrfToken` if one already
> exists."

The first call is sequential because it establishes the shared summarization service file
(`src/services/aiSummaryService.*`) and the CSRF helper that subsequent targets reuse.

### 5.2 Verify service + CSRF helper exist

Before spawning more agents, verify:

- The summarization service file exists (default `src/services/aiSummaryService.ts`).
- `getCsrfToken` is defined once in the codebase (or imported from a pre-existing helper).

### 5.3 Invoke the agent for remaining targets — sequentially

Per `plugins/power-pages/AGENTS.md`, agent spawning is **sequential**. Invoke
`ai-webapi-integration` once per remaining target, waiting for each completion before starting the
next. Each target only adds an independent exported function, a framework wrapper (if not already
present), and wires one UI file — there are no merge conflicts, but the sequential rule keeps
failure modes simple.

If there is only one target total, skip 5.3.

### 5.4 Replace placeholder POSTs

For any placeholder `InstructionIdentifier` body the Explore agent flagged in Phase 2, the
sub-agent will have replaced them. Confirm by grepping for `InstructionIdentifier` in the affected
files and verifying each resolved call uses the real entity set and id.

### 5.5 Offer to commit

Don't commit automatically — on iterative runs an unprompted `git commit` here creates a noisy
series of commits for what is effectively one set of changes. Use `AskUserQuestion`:

| Question | Header | Options |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Commit these Layer 3 integration changes now? | Commit | Yes, commit now (Recommended), Skip — I'll commit later |

On **Yes**:

```powershell
git add -A
git commit -m "Add AI summarization integration for [targets]"
```

On **Skip**: proceed without committing. The user will batch the commit themselves at the end.

**Output**: summarization service + framework wrappers + UI call sites created for every confirmed
target.

---

## Phase 6: Configure Layer 3 settings

**Goal**: Register the `Summarization/*` site settings via the `ai-webapi-settings-architect` agent.

### 6.1 Skip-check

Skip this phase when both of the following are true:

- Every confirmed target is Search Summary (search has no per-call `Summarization/*` site settings;
  see [ai-api-reference.md](references/ai-api-reference.md#1-search-summary-api)).
- No Data Summarization or Case preset target was added in Phase 3.

For search-only, remind the user to enable **Site search with generative AI (preview)** in the
site's Copilot workspace after deploy, and proceed to Phase 7.

### 6.2 Confirm deployment prerequisite still holds

Phase 1.5 already gated on `.powerpages-site` existing. Re-check it here as a guard — if it has
disappeared between Phase 1 and now (rare, but possible if the user manually cleaned the folder),
stop and re-run the Phase 1.5 bootstrap-deploy prompt. Do NOT silently fall through into the
architect with a missing folder.

### 6.3 Invoke `ai-webapi-settings-architect`

Invoke the agent at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/ai-webapi-settings-architect.md` via `Task`:

> "Analyse this Power Pages SPA site and propose generative-AI summarization site settings.
> The following AI APIs were integrated in Phase 5: [data / case-preset list with per-target
> `InstructionIdentifier` values]. Check for existing `Summarization/*` settings. Layer 1
> (`Webapi/<table>/*`) and Layer 2 (table permissions) were configured in Phase 4 via
> `/integrate-webapi` in AI-only read mode — verify they are present on disk and cite them as
> met in your plan's prerequisite table. Propose the AI plan via plan mode, and on approval
> create the YAMLs with `create-site-setting.js`."

Wait for the agent to complete. If it reports missing Layer 1/2 prerequisites, something in
Phase 4 didn't land — read the file system, identify the gap, and surface it to the user rather
than attempting to create Layer 1/2 files here.

### 6.4 Offer to commit

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

| Question | Header | Options |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Commit the new `Summarization/*` site settings? | Commit | Yes, commit now (Recommended), Skip — I'll commit later |

On **Yes**:

```powershell
git add -A
git commit -m "Add AI summarization site settings"
```

On **Skip**: proceed without committing.

**Output**: `Summarization/Data/Enable`, `Summarization/prompt/<id>` settings created.

---

## Phase 7: Verify

**Goal**: Confirm every expected file exists, all POSTs set both required headers, and the project
builds.

> **Preview-feature reminder** (per the Preview notice at the top of this skill): a green build
> doesn't mean the API will return a summary at runtime. Two things can still block it:
>
> 1. **Admin-level governance** (tenant PowerShell setting or Copilot Hub → Power Pages →
>    Settings, env or site scope). Data Summarization surfaces this as HTTP 400 with error code
>    `90041001`; Search Summary surfaces it as HTTP 200 with an embedded `{ Code: 400, Message:
>    "Gen AI Search is disabled." }` envelope — both mean "an admin has disabled AI somewhere
>    above the site level", and retry won't help.
> 2. **Site-level maker toggle** for Search Summary — Set up workspace → Copilot → Site search
>    (preview) → Enable Site search with generative AI (preview). Greyed out in the studio when
>    admin-level governance blocks it.
>
> Tell the user now so they aren't surprised when the post-deploy test hits either disablement
> shape. Walk the admin hierarchy in `references/ai-api-reference.md` §1 if it does.

### 7.1 File inventory

For each confirmed target, confirm:

- **Service file**: `src/services/aiSummaryService.ts` (or project-convention equivalent) contains
  the expected exported function (`fetchSearchSummary`, `fetchDataSummary`, or `fetchCaseSummary`).
- **Framework wrapper** (non-Astro): React hook in `src/hooks/`, Vue composable in
  `src/composables/`, or Angular service in `src/app/services/`.
- **UI wiring**: at least one page/component imports the service or wrapper and calls it.
- **Shared API client** `src/shared/powerPagesApi.ts` exists when any data/case target was in scope.

### 7.2 Header contract grep

```
Grep: "_api/search/v1\\.0/summary|_api/summarization/data/v1\\.0/" in src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,vue,astro}
```

For every file that matches, verify the surrounding fetch includes:

- `__RequestVerificationToken` (CSRF token, fetched from `/_layout/tokenhtml`)
- `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`

For data summarization calls, additionally verify:

- The URL contains `$select=` (no wildcards)
- `OData-MaxVersion: 4.0` and `OData-Version: 4.0` headers are set

If any file is missing a required header, fix it before proceeding — these are hard rules. Missing
CSRF produces 500s; missing `$select` produces 403s.

### 7.3 Build check

```powershell
cd "<PROJECT_ROOT>"
npm run build
```

Fix any type or import errors. Common issues: missing import of the summarization service in a
wired page; type mismatch between `DataSummaryResponse` and the UI consumer; duplicate
`getCsrfToken` declarations (if Phase 5 failed to reuse the existing helper).

### 7.4 Present verification results

| Target file | API | Service fn | Wrapper | UI call site | Headers ✓ | `$select` ✓ |
|-------------|-----|-----------|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| `src/pages/SearchResults.tsx` | Search summary | `fetchSearchSummary` | `useSearchSummary` | Yes | Yes | n/a |
| `src/pages/CaseDetail.tsx` | Case preset | `fetchCaseSummary` | `useCaseSummary` | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx` | Data summarization | `fetchDataSummary` | `useProductSummary` | Yes | Yes | Yes |

(Same row order, same example file paths, and the same "Search summary / Case preset / Data
summarization" labels as the Phase 2 manifest example, so a maintainer reading both tables can
trace each row top-to-bottom.)

**Build status:** Pass / Fail (with details).

**Output**: all integration files verified; project builds.

---

## Phase 8: Review & Deploy

**Goal**: Record skill usage, present a summary, and offer deployment.

### 8.1 Record skill usage

> Reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/skill-tracking-reference.md`

Use `--skillName "AddAiWebapi"`.

### 8.2 Present summary

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Web roles | Created via /create-webroles / Reused existing / Skipped | role name(s) |
| Layer 1/2 (Web API settings + permissions) | Created via /integrate-webapi / Reused existing / Skipped (search-only) | list of files written |
| Summarization service | Created / Extended | exported functions, file path |
| Framework wrappers | Created / Extended | hook/composable/service paths |
| UI call sites | Wired | list of files |
| Layer 3 (Summarization/* settings) | Created / Already existed / Skipped | `Summarization/Data/Enable`, one per prompt |

### 8.3 Ask to deploy

| Question | Header | Options |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Everything is ready. Deploy the site so the summarization APIs become live? | Deploy | Yes, deploy now (Recommended), No, I'll deploy later |

**Yes**: invoke `/deploy-site`.
**No**: acknowledge. Remind that the API calls will not work until the site is deployed with the
new settings and permissions.

### 8.4 Post-deploy notes

- **Site search with generative AI** (for the search summary): toggle
  **Copilot → Site search (preview) → "Enable Site search with generative AI (preview)"** in the
  Set up workspace.
- **Test recipe** (matches the Microsoft Learn case-page walkthrough):
  - **Case preset** — sign in as a user with the assigned web role, go to **My support**, create a
    new case with a filled-in description, **add at least one comment** (the preset's
    `$expand=incident_adx_portalcomments($select=description)` returns nothing for an empty
    comment collection, which trips error `90041005`), then click the chevron on the Copilot
    summary card. Confirm `/_api/summarization/data/v1.0/incidents(<id>)?...` returns 200 with a
    non-empty `Summary`.
  - **Data summarization** — open a record-detail page for the target table. Click the summary
    action. Confirm 200 in the network tab and the returned `Summary` renders. Click a
    recommendation chip and confirm the follow-up request sends `RecommendationConfig` (not
    `InstructionIdentifier`) and returns a refined summary.
  - **Search summary** — perform a search. Confirm `/_api/search/v1.0/summary` returns 200, the
    summary paragraph renders above the keyword results, the inline `[[N]](url)` markdown is
    rendered as framework-native anchors (not raw markdown text), and `[1]`, `[2]`, ... tokens
    are clickable links pointing at the **rewritten SPA route** (e.g. `/knowledge/<guid>`),
    **not** the raw `/page-not-found/?id=<guid>` URLs the API returns on a SPA site. If a
    citation is dropping the user on the built-in 404 page, the `extractKnowledgeArticleId`
    rewrite isn't wired — see the agent's Step 5 "Citation URL rewriting" section.
  - **Disabled-state card** (expected branch, not a bug) — if the search shows a card headed
    *"AI search summary is turned off for this site"* with a link to the enable doc instead of a
    summary paragraph, the Search Summary endpoint returned its 200-with-embedded-error envelope
    (`{ Code: 400, Message: "Gen AI Search is disabled." }`). This happens when any level of the
    admin hierarchy has AI disabled — most commonly the site-level maker toggle. Walk the user
    through the checklist in `references/ai-api-reference.md` §1 "Troubleshooting: AI feature
    appears disabled (admin hierarchy)". A retry will never fix this; an admin or maker has to
    flip the toggle. For Data Summarization the equivalent branch is an HTTP 400 with
    `error.code = 90041001` — same checklist, same resolution path.
- **Error-code reference**: full table of the five documented `90041xxx` codes — `90041001`,
  `90041003`, `90041004`, `90041005`, `90041006` — and what each means lives in
  [`references/ai-api-reference.md` §2 Error codes](references/ai-api-reference.md#error-codes-http-400).
  Open it when the user reports a 400. Two runtime-specific notes worth surfacing up front:
  - **403 on a summarization call is always a Layer 1/2 issue** (column casing in
    `Webapi/<table>/fields`, or missing `read: true` table permission) — re-run
    `/integrate-webapi` in AI-only read mode to fix it rather than hand-editing YAML.
  - **`90041001` (Data Summarization) and the Search Summary 200-envelope** both mean "AI is
    disabled somewhere in the tenant/environment/site hierarchy". Retry won't help; an admin has
    to change governance or a maker has to flip the site toggle. The
    [Troubleshooting: AI feature appears disabled (admin hierarchy)](references/ai-api-reference.md#troubleshooting-ai-feature-appears-disabled-admin-hierarchy)
    checklist in §1 of the reference is the resolution playbook for both shapes.
- **Column permission profiles can silently hide content.** If the summary has obvious omissions,
  check Dataverse column permission profiles on the web role before suspecting the prompt or
  fields list.

**Output**: summary presented, deployment completed or deferred, post-deploy guidance given.

## Important Notes

### Throughout all phases

- **Use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate** to track progress at every phase.
- **Ask for user confirmation** at key decision points (list below).
- **Sequential agent spawning** — per `plugins/power-pages/AGENTS.md:67`. Never spawn `ai-webapi-integration` in parallel across targets.
- **Commit at milestones** — after implementation (Phase 5) and after settings creation (Phase 6).
- **Never use an OData wrapper for summarization fetches** — raw `fetch` only.
- **Never write Layer 1/2 files directly** — always delegate to `/integrate-webapi` / `/create-webroles`. This skill is Layer 3.

### Key decision points (wait for user)

1. At Phase 1.5: bootstrap deploy or stop (if `.powerpages-site` missing).
2. After Phase 3: confirm which APIs / targets to integrate.
3. At Phase 4.2: create missing web role via `/create-webroles` (if needed).
4. At Phase 4.2 (Skip path): confirm continuing despite known broken-runtime risk.
5. Inside the Phase 4.3 `/integrate-webapi` delegation: approve its architect plans (sub-skill owns these prompts).
6. At Phase 5.5: commit the integration changes now or later.
7. Inside the Phase 6.3 `ai-webapi-settings-architect` call: approve its plan.
8. At Phase 6.4: commit the new settings now or later.
9. At Phase 8.3: deploy now or later.

### List-summary use case playbook

When the target is a LIST of records (not a single record), the defaults for a single-record
Copilot card (case preset style) are the wrong defaults. Apply every rule below:

1. **Use the collection endpoint** — `POST /_api/summarization/data/v1.0/<entitySet>?$select=...` —
   not the account-anchored `accounts(<id>)?$expand=<navprop>` form. Row-level security already
   scopes the collection; the extra `/_api/accounts?$top=1` lookup and fragile nested
   `$filter;$top;$orderby` inside `$expand` are both avoidable.
2. **Ask "auto-load or button?"** — per the Phase 3 follow-up above. Auto is usually right for
   short lists; button is safer when the collection is large or filters change often.
3. **Scope: mirror the existing list fetch — OR confirm with the user when the scope is
   ambiguous.** If the target page has an existing list fetch AND the user's request is
   generic ("add a summary to this list"), mirror `$filter`/`$orderby` from the existing fetch
   so the summary covers the same rows the user sees. `$select` / `$expand` can be supersets
   (add a lookup expand → name for AI context), but never drop columns the UI displays. **When
   the user's request contains a scope qualifier the existing fetch doesn't have** (e.g., "open
   invoices" when the page shows all), **OR the target page has no existing list fetch at all**
   (e.g., a Dashboard page), **do NOT guess the `$filter` — ASK the user** via a Phase 3 scope
   follow-up. Silently inventing an OData filter gives the user a summary they didn't ask for.
   Strip `$top` entirely, and do NOT carry over any `Prefer: odata.maxpagesize` header —
   pagination is UI behaviour, not summary scope. Let `Summarization/Data/ContentSizeLimit`
   govern the server-side cap.
4. **Use the tabular-insight prompt**, not a narrative prompt. The 3-insights / <=200-words /
   no-suggested-actions pattern produces much stronger output than "write a 4-sentence narrative".
5. **Include 1–2 domain-neutral few-shot examples** in the prompt (sales-by-region, software
   purchases). Avoid domain-matched examples — the model copies example figures instead of
   grounding on the user's data.
6. **Ship `normalizeSummaryString`** in the service layer. The tabular-insight prompt returns
   `Summary` as a JSON-encoded string array; rendering it raw shows `[\"...\"]` in the UI.
7. **Ship a tiny safe-markdown renderer** in the UI (React/Vue/Angular/Astro). Insights contain
   `**bold**` and `\n\n` separators; `{summary}` renders them as raw asterisks.
8. **Use YAML block-literal** (`value: |` with indented content) for any prompt > 200 chars or
   containing `:`, `|`, `` ` ``, `<|`, `> `, a colon-quote, or a newline. Plain-scalar YAML breaks
   `pac pages upload-code-site` silently for these.
9. **Verify `$expand` nav-property casing** against Dataverse metadata
   (`EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='<primary>')/ManyToOneRelationships` →
   `ReferencedEntityNavigationPropertyName`). The nav prop is PascalCase; the lookup column is
   lowercase. Mismatched casing returns 400.
10. **Set `Summarization/Data/ContentSizeLimit = 200000`** by default for list-summary targets —
    enough headroom for ~500 rows of narrow records. Bump only when real data hits error
    `90041004`.

### Progress tracking

Before starting Phase 1, create a task list with all phases using `TaskCreate`:

| Task subject | activeForm | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Check site is ready | Checking site prerequisites | Locate project root, detect framework, check data model, deployment status, web-role inventory |
| Find where AI summaries fit | Scanning code for AI summary opportunities | Use Explore agent to find search/data/case candidates, existing infra, and delegation decisions |
| Confirm what to add | Confirming the AI summary plan | Present manifest and confirm which APIs and targets to integrate |
| Set up data access for AI | Setting up Web API access and permissions | Invoke /create-webroles if needed, then /integrate-webapi in AI-only read mode (or skip for search-only) |
| Add AI summary code | Adding AI summary code to your pages | Sequential ai-webapi-integration calls: first target creates shared service + CSRF helper, remaining targets extend it |
| Register AI prompts | Registering AI prompt settings | Invoke ai-webapi-settings-architect to create Summarization/* settings |
| Verify everything | Verifying file inventory, headers, and the build | Confirm service file, wrappers, UI wiring, header contract, run project build |
| Review and deploy | Reviewing summary and deploying | Record skill usage, present summary, offer /deploy-site, give post-deploy guidance |

Mark each task `in_progress` when starting and `completed` when done via `TaskUpdate`.
