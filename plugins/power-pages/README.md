# Power Pages Plugin

Create and deploy Power Pages code sites using modern frontend frameworks. This plugin provides a complete workflow — from scaffolding a new site to deploying it, setting up data models, authentication, and Web API integrations — all through conversational AI skills.

**Supported frameworks**: React, Angular, Vue, Astro (static SPAs)

## Installation

### From the marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace add microsoft/power-platform-skills
/plugin install power-pages@power-platform-skills
```

### From a local clone

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/power-platform-skills/plugins/power-pages
```

## Hook behavior

The plugin centralizes Claude Code hook registration in `hooks/hooks.json`.

- `PostToolUse` hooks match the `Skill` tool so validation runs when a tracked Power Pages skill completes.
- Command validators and checklist verification are maintained centrally instead of in per-skill frontmatter.

This keeps hook behavior in one place and avoids relying on skill-frontmatter hook registration.

## Skills

The plugin provides 16 skills that cover the full lifecycle of a Power Pages code site — scaffolding, deployment, data modeling, backend integration, authentication, testing, and auditing. Each skill is invoked conversationally — just describe what you want to do.

### Site scaffolding and deployment

#### `/create-site`

> "Create a Power Pages site with React for a job board"

Scaffolds a complete code site from a framework template, applies your design direction (fonts, colors, layout), builds out pages and components, and provides a live preview in the browser throughout development.

- Choose from React, Vue, Angular, or Astro
- Real images from Unsplash (no placeholders)
- Live browser preview during development
- Git commits at each milestone

#### `/deploy-site`

> "Deploy my site to Power Pages"

Builds your project and uploads it to your Power Pages environment using `pac pages upload-code-site`. Handles common blockers like JavaScript attachment restrictions.

- Verifies PAC CLI installation and authentication
- Confirms target environment before deploying
- Creates `.powerpages-site` folder with deployment artifacts

#### `/activate-site`

> "Activate my site"

Provisions a website record in your Power Platform environment so your site is accessible at a public URL.

- Generates a subdomain suggestion (you choose the final name)
- Polls provisioning status until the site is live
- Provides the final site URL

#### `/test-site`

> "Test my deployed site at https://contoso.powerappsportals.com"

Runtime-tests a deployed, activated site using a real browser (via the bundled Playwright MCP). Crawls discoverable links, verifies pages render, captures network traffic for API calls, and produces a test report.

- Browser-based navigation and page crawling
- Network request verification for Web API / Server Logic / Cloud Flow endpoints
- Console and network error capture
- Screenshots on failure

### Data modeling

#### `/setup-datamodel`

> "Create Dataverse tables for my site"

Analyzes your site's requirements and creates Dataverse tables, columns, and relationships via OData API calls.

- Spawns a **Data Model Architect** agent that proposes tables based on your site's code
- Alternatively, you can upload an ER diagram
- Generates a `.datamodel-manifest.json` used by downstream skills
- Visualizes the data model as a Mermaid ER diagram

#### `/add-sample-data`

> "Add sample data to my tables"

Populates your Dataverse tables with realistic, contextually appropriate records.

- Reads table definitions from `.datamodel-manifest.json` or queries OData metadata
- Generates values that match column types and names (emails, dates, currencies, etc.)
- Inserts records in dependency order (parent tables first)

### Backend integration

#### `/integrate-backend`

> "I need to send a confirmation email when someone submits the contact form"

Router skill that analyzes your business problem and recommends the right backend approach — Web API, Server Logic, Cloud Flow, or a combination — then hands off to the specialized skill(s). Use this as the entry point when you're not sure which integration path fits your scenario.

- Generates a visual backend plan (HTML) with the recommended approach and trade-offs
- Routes to `/integrate-webapi`, `/add-server-logic`, or `/add-cloud-flow`
- Supports multi-approach plans (e.g., Web API for CRUD + Cloud Flow for notifications)

#### `/integrate-webapi`

> "Connect my site to the Dataverse tables"

Orchestrates the full Web API integration lifecycle — from analyzing your site's code to identify where data is needed, through generating typed API code for each table, to configuring table permissions and site settings so the APIs work in production.

The skill first scans your codebase to find components using mock data, placeholder fetch calls, or hardcoded arrays, then maps them to your Dataverse tables. It processes each table sequentially, spawning a dedicated **Web API Integration** agent that creates the integration code. After all tables are wired up, a **Table Permissions** agent proposes CRUD permissions and scopes, and a **Web API Settings** agent proposes site settings with case-sensitive validated column names queried directly from Dataverse — or you can upload your own permissions diagram instead.

**What gets created:**

- Shared `powerPagesApi.ts` client with anti-forgery token management, OData URL builder, and exponential backoff retry logic
- TypeScript entity types and domain mappers per table
- CRUD service layer per table using `/_api/` endpoints with dual token headers and `@odata.bind` for lookups
- Framework-specific patterns: React hooks, Vue composables, Angular injectable services
- Table permission YAML files and site setting YAML files (with explicit validated column lists by default; use `*` only for aggregate OData scenarios that otherwise 403)

**What gets updated:**

- Existing components are refactored to use real API calls (mock data and placeholder fetches are replaced)
- `.powerpages-site/table-permissions/` and `.powerpages-site/site-settings/` directories are populated for deployment

#### `/add-ai-webapi`

> "Add AI summaries to my site"

> ⚠️ **Public preview** — Power Pages generative-AI summarization (Search Summary, Data Summarization, and the Case-page Copilot preset) is in **public preview**. The APIs, behaviour, error shapes, and admin/governance toggles can change before general availability, and they are gated by a three-level admin hierarchy (tenant PowerShell setting → Copilot Hub environment/site governance → site maker toggle). Don't take a runtime dependency on them for production-critical paths until they reach GA.

Integrates Power Pages generative-AI summarization APIs into a code site: the **Search Summary API** (`/_api/search/v1.0/summary`), the **Data Summarization API** (`/_api/summarization/data/v1.0/...`), and the canonical **Case-page Copilot preset** for the incident table.

The skill scans your code for search pages, record detail pages, and case/incident pages and proposes which APIs to wire where. For any data / case-preset target that is missing its Web API prerequisites (Layer 1 `Webapi/<table>/*` settings, Layer 2 table permissions, or the shared `powerPagesApi.ts` client), the skill delegates to `/integrate-webapi` in an **AI-only read mode** — read-only permissions, minimal fields list (no primary key, only `_<col>_value` for lookups) — and to `/create-webroles` if no web role exists yet. Once Layer 1/2 is in place, the skill spawns the **AI Web API Integration** agent sequentially per target to create a single summarization service (`fetchSearchSummary`, `fetchDataSummary`, `fetchCaseSummary`) with correct CSRF handling, a framework-idiomatic wrapper, and real UI call sites. Finally, the **AI Web API Settings Architect** is invoked for Layer 3 to propose the `Summarization/Data/Enable` toggle and per-prompt `Summarization/prompt/<identifier>` settings.

**What gets created:**

- `src/services/aiSummaryService.ts` (or extended if it already exists) with raw `fetch` + both required CSRF headers
- Framework-specific wrapper (React hook / Vue composable / Angular service)
- Real call sites in the target page(s) with loading, error, and recommendation-button handling
- `Summarization/Data/Enable` site setting and one `Summarization/prompt/<identifier>` per prompt
- `Webapi/<table>/enabled` / `Webapi/<table>/fields`, read-only table permissions, and the shared `powerPagesApi.ts` client for the summarised tables and every `$expand` target (delegated to `/integrate-webapi`)

#### `/add-server-logic`

> "Move my pricing calculation out of the browser and onto the server"

Creates and manages Power Pages Server Logic — server-side JavaScript that runs securely on the Power Pages runtime. Covers the full lifecycle: gathering requirements, fetching Microsoft Learn docs for reference, implementing the handler, configuring site settings, and deploying.

- Grounded in live Microsoft Learn docs (via the bundled MCP)
- Generates the server-side handler and its deployment metadata
- Wires up the client-side call site in your frontend code
- Handles site-setting flags required to enable Server Logic

#### `/add-cloud-flow`

> "When a user submits an application, kick off my existing approval flow"

Integrates Power Automate cloud flows into a Power Pages site. Discovers flows available in the environment, suggests relevant ones for your intent, identifies scenarios and web roles, creates flow metadata, and generates the client-side code to invoke the flow.

- Lists available cloud flows in the environment
- Handles both new flow registration and adding already-registered flows to additional pages
- Generates metadata files and client-side call-site code
- Configures web role access for the flow

### Security and access

#### `/create-webroles`

> "Create web roles for my site"

Generates web role YAML files in your `.powerpages-site` directory for managing user access.

- Discovers existing roles before creating new ones
- Generates proper UUIDs for each role
- Enforces uniqueness constraints (one anonymous role, one authenticated role)

#### `/setup-auth`

> "Set up authentication for my site"

Adds login/logout functionality and role-based authorization to your site.

- Auth service with anti-forgery token handling
- Login/logout UI component
- Role-based UI patterns (show/hide elements by role)
- Framework-specific implementation (hooks, composables, services)

#### `/audit-permissions`

> "Check my table permissions for security issues"

Audits existing table permissions on a deployed or in-progress site by analyzing them against the site code and live Dataverse metadata. Produces a visual HTML audit report grouped by severity with suggested fixes.

- Findings grouped as critical / warning / info / pass
- Cross-references code usage, web roles, and Dataverse schema
- Suggests concrete fixes for each issue

### Polish

#### `/add-seo`

> "Add SEO to my site"

Adds search engine optimization artifacts: `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and meta tags (Open Graph, Twitter Cards).

- Auto-discovers routes from your framework's router
- Generates sitemap with production URLs
- Adds viewport, charset, description, and social sharing meta tags

### Support

#### `/report-issue`

> "Report a bug with the create-site skill"

Collects context about the current session and opens a pre-filled GitHub issue against [microsoft/power-platform-skills](https://github.com/microsoft/power-platform-skills/issues).

- Captures the skill(s) involved and recent error messages
- Attaches relevant file paths and environment info
- Opens the issue in your browser for final review

## Agents

The plugin includes 6 specialized agents that are spawned automatically by skills when needed:

| Agent | Purpose | Triggered by |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Model Architect** | Analyzes your site and proposes a Dataverse data model with an ER diagram | `/setup-datamodel` |
| **Web API Integration** | Creates typed API client, services, and hooks for a Dataverse table | `/integrate-webapi` (directly); `/add-ai-webapi` (transitively, when it delegates) |
| **Table Permissions** | Proposes table permissions (web roles, CRUD flags, scopes) with a visual Mermaid diagram | `/integrate-webapi`, `/audit-permissions`; `/add-ai-webapi` (transitively, in AI-only read mode) |
| **Web API Settings** | Proposes Web API site settings with case-sensitive validated column names from Dataverse | `/integrate-webapi` (directly); `/add-ai-webapi` (transitively, in AI-only read mode) |
| **AI Web API Integration** *(public preview)* | Creates raw-`fetch` summarization service with CSRF, framework wrapper, and UI wiring | `/add-ai-webapi` |
| **AI Web API Settings Architect** *(public preview)* | Proposes `Summarization/Data/Enable` and maker-defined `Summarization/prompt/<identifier>` site settings | `/add-ai-webapi` |

The Data Model Architect, Table Permissions, and Web API Settings agents are **read-only** — they analyze and propose but never create or modify resources directly. You review and approve their proposals before any changes are made.

## Bundled MCP servers

The plugin ships with two MCP servers configured in `.mcp.json` — they start automatically when the plugin loads:

| Server | Purpose
|---|---|
| **playwright** | Headless browser automation for live previews and runtime tests |
| **microsoft-learn** | Grounded search/fetch over official Microsoft Learn docs |

## Typical Workflow

A common end-to-end workflow looks like this:

```
1.  /create-site        →  Scaffold + design + build pages
2.  /deploy-site        →  Upload to Power Pages environment
3.  /activate-site      →  Provision a public URL
4.  /setup-datamodel    →  Create Dataverse tables
5.  /add-sample-data    →  Populate tables with test records
6.  /integrate-backend  →  Pick the right backend approach (Web API / Server Logic / Cloud Flow)
7.  /add-ai-webapi      →  Wire Copilot / search / data summarization APIs into pages (public preview)
8.  /create-webroles    →  Define access roles
9.  /setup-auth         →  Add login/logout + role-based UI
10. /audit-permissions  →  Verify table permissions are safe
11. /add-seo            →  Search engine optimization
12. /deploy-site        →  Push final changes live
13. /test-site          →  Runtime smoke test on the live URL
```

Steps can be run independently — you don't need to follow this exact order. Each skill checks its own prerequisites and will tell you if something is missing. If something goes wrong, `/report-issue` opens a pre-filled GitHub issue.

## Running Without Interruption

The plugin invokes multiple tools during a session. To reduce approval prompts:

**Option 1 — Permission mode (recommended)**

```jsonc
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "defaultMode": "acceptEdits",
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm run *)",
      "Bash(git *)",
      "Bash(pac *)",
      "Bash(az *)",
      "Bash(node *)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Option 2 — Auto-accept all**

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

## Testing validator scripts

Run the validator unit tests with Node's built-in test runner:

```bash
node --test plugins/power-pages/scripts/tests/
```

To validate table-permission relationship names against live Dataverse metadata during local testing, run:

```bash
node plugins/power-pages/scripts/validate-permissions-schema.js --projectRoot /path/to/site --validate-dataverse-relationships --envUrl https://your-org.crm.dynamics.com
```

This Dataverse relationship check is intended for local validation only and should not be used in CI.
